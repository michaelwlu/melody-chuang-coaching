## Description

I created this website for my friend Melody's life coaching business. It was designed to replace a defunct Squarespace site and also represented an opportunity for me to practice making a responsive website with forms and some light SEO. A simple server runs in the backend to store submitted form data in a MongoDB Atlas database as well as send emails to both the business owner and form submitter. In addition, the website features widgets for Instagram, Facebook Groups, and Spotify.
